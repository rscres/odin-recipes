        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A friend of mine sent this recipe to me when I got my first apartment, because she knows how much I hate cooking! 
        It's really easy -- even I can make it -- and tastes great. I'm not sure where she found the recipe, but it included the note 
        'Good source of protein, vitamin A, B group vitamins, calcium.'</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1(12 ounce) package of macaroni</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>2 cups of milk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon of butter, melted</li>
